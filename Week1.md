What is the most interesting thing I learned about money or finance this week, and how do I see it applying to my life or the world around me in 2025?

Inflation and how it silently erodes wealth is the most interesting thing I learned more about this week. Even though inflation was not discussed in depth in any of the study materials, it is understandable as it is the 1st assignment. It made me want to delve into the topic more, and I learned more about the factors that cause inflation to fluctuate and how parameters like interest rates could control it. This also reminded me of the importance of investing in general and how it helps prevent wealth degradation. The understanding of inflation is something that is still not very common in society. People know the effects of inflation very well, and it has a significant influence on politics, but the core knowledge of inflation and its causes is still lacking. This is something I see myself applying in the sense of bringing awareness of it as it is something that affects every one of us.

The most interesting new thing I learned this week is probably the different types of money. Even though I was aware of it, I didnâ€™t know there was a form of classifying it as fiat currency, commodity money and digital currency, the latter of which I was more aware of. Also, how the world shifted from gold-back currencies to a system that is a completely free market and dependent on trust was interesting. Despite the shift to fiat money, gold's value has continued to rise. The idea that gold remains an eternal store of value was my biggest takeaway this week.
